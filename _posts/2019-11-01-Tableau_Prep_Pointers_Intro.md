**Introduction to Tableau Prep Pointers**

If you’re a Tableau Desktop user, you’ve probably heard that Tableau recently launched a new product called Tableau Prep that comes with your desktop license. In this video series, we’ll explore its features and share some tips and techniques we’ve learned from using it on real client projects.

As Tableau already includes powerful features for combining data from different sources and shaping for your visualizations, you may be wondering why you need Tableau Prep at all? Here are a few reasons:

- Tableau Prep lets you create a step by step flow so that each operation can act upon the results of the previous step. 
- Within a step you can see a preview of exactly how that step is affecting your data as a distribution, or with a subset of your data.
- You can create steps that clean, filter and include calculations.
- You can split your data flow into branches then merge them back together. 
- When joining different data sources, you can see the details of what data will be included or excluded using the graphic interface. 
- You can aggregate or pivot your data.
- Every operation is captured in a change history that you can inspect and reorder.
- And like the desktop version, it’s all done in a very visual, intuitive way that requires minimal coding.
