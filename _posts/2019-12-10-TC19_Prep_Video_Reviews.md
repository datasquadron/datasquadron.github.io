## Bringing Data Science to the End-User with Tableau

**Level:** Intermediate | **SquadRating:** :star::star: (2 out of 5)

Takes awhile to get going (Hands on prep starts at 15 minutes). Connecting to Python or R server. Not an impressive use of Prep. Just unioning some data and sending it to R, where the hard work happens. If you can do all the work to collect the data and set up the R server, you donâ€™t need Prep for the really simple data unioning and scheduled run.
