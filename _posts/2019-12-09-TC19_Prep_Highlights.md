## State of Indiana: How Tableau Prep Saved Our End-user Experience

**Level:** Advanced | **SquadRating:** 

Their role is to consolidate 35+ data sources for all state agencies. Tiled dashboard each with vizes in tooltips. But UX suffered from loading delays. Improved by preprocessing in Prep. But recording didn't capture the live demo of his dashboard (just stayed on PPT slide), and he showed very little of what he actually built in prep.

## Bringing Data Science to the End-User with Tableau

**Level:** Intermediate | **SquadRating:** 

Takes awhile to get going (Hands on prep starts at 15 minutes). Connecting to Python or R server. Not an impressive use of Prep. Just unioning some data and sending it to R, where the hard work happens. If you can do all the work to collect the data and set up the R server, you donâ€™t need Prep for the really simple data unioning and scheduled run.
