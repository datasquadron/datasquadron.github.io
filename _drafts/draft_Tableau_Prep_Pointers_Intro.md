**Introduction to Tableau Prep Pointers**

If you’re a Tableau Desktop user, you’re probably heard that Tableau recently launched a new product called Tableau Prep that comes with your desktop license. In this video series, we’ll explore its features and share some tips and techniques we’ve learned from using it on real client projects.

As Tableau already includes powerful features for combining data from different sources and shaping for your visualizations, you may be wondering why you need Tableau Prep at all? 

- Tableau Prep lets you create a step by step flow so that in each operation you can act upon the results of the previous step. 
- Within a step you can see a preview of exactly how that step is affecting your data as a distribution, or with a subset of your data.
- You can create steps that create steps that clean, filter and include calculaions.
- You can split your data flow into branches, then join or join them back together. Within the inspection window you can see the details of what data will be included or excluded from each step using the graphic interface. 
- You can aggregation your data and every operation is captured in a change history that you can inspect and reorder.
- And like the desktop version, it’s all done in a very visual, intuitive way that requires minimal coding.
